Yeo is a declarative dotfiles snapshot tool built in Python with zero third-party dependencies.

Yeo allows you to copy your dotfiles, or any set of specified files, into a different directory and keep them in sync by running the `sync` command. Your dotfiles snapshot can then be used with a VCS, uploaded to GitHub, etc.

## Using Yeo

Yeo is still a WIP.

### Prerequisites

While yeo is in active development and using a pre-release model, we recommend testing it out by using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and `uvx`. 

1. Create a directory for your dotfiles to be managed.
2. Run `uvx yeo init` from inside of the directory. This will create a `yeo.json` file.
3. Open the `yeo.json` file and replace the specified paths with your desired dotfiles. Paths assume a starting `~/` directory and work from there.
4. Run `uvx yeo sync` to sync your dotfiles.

That's it!
